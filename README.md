## Compile Data

Run `python wiki_scraper.py`, which will generate a CSV

## Process

`network_builder.py` cuts the data from above into 3 splits (for the 3 group members). It also contains other network visualization methods, but are unused at this point.

Run `add_birth.py` a few times for the 3 splits of data

Combine the data with `combine_data.py`
